<br />A programming game. No computer knowledge required. No keyboard shortcut wizardry.
<br />Just a team and a ball.</p><p>Serious gaming has expanded across the agile world in the last few years. However, most of the games still focus on the &quot;individuals and interactions&quot; side. Soft(ware)ball is a game that brings balance by putting software design issues on par with people issues.</p><p>Nevertheless, this game is not developer-centric activity such as coding dojos that require programming language skills.</p><p>This game uses a very simple &quot;software&quot; concept : human &quot;components&quot;, embodied by members of the audience, are given instructions to move a ball around. This concept allows non-technical people to play an active part in the game like any other developer.</p><p>The game pace is driven by the expectations of a customer that is constantly discovering new features for a better software.</p><p>People with no coding experience will be able to move into a developer&apos;s shoes and get a grasp of typical coding challenges: is this refactoring worth the cost? how can I simplify my design to keep it flexible?</p><p>Seasonned developers will re-discover standard practices (refactoring, group programming...) or principles (single responsibility, open/closed, dependency inversion...) under a new light.</p></td></tr>

You might find out that you want to attend this Agile education session at the XP Days. :-)</p><p>Since a few years Scrum is used to educate students (teens and adults), this has evolved to the eduScrum framework. 
<br />With eduScrum students work together in an energetic, targeted, effective and efficient way.
<br />With eduScrum students are stimulated to develop into a valuable member of a team.
<br />eduScrum ascertains a mind-set that aims for constant improvement.
<br />eduScrum is a framework for a cocreative process and supporting.</p><p>This new way of education has lead to remarkable results but most of all motivated students that take ownership of their learning process. Once you have seen this live, you&rsquo;re overwhelmed and understand why this approach has such a potential. Needles to say that this boosted our interest and we decided to devote a fair amount of time and energy to support this fantastic and radical innovation in education.  </p><p>So, together with the help of some special friends, we&rsquo;ve created a session about eduScrum that will bring you all the secrets you want to know!
<br />In the true spirit of the eXPerience Days we&rsquo;ve arranged a teacher and a group of high school students to share their experiences with you!

  <tr><td colspan="2" ><p>Innovation is always hard. Or is it?</p><p>1. Background
<br />I was a year ago presented with &quot;Communicating through Secure email with our end-users&quot; as the solution for a customers response to the question - &quot;How will your company become Market leader within your primary field of business?&quot;.
<br />10 years ago that could have been the solution. But not today.</p><p>2. Creating a mental model
<br />I kept thinking of Henry Ford&apos;s quote on &ldquo;If I had asked people what they wanted, they would have said faster horses.&rdquo;
<br />So I started thinking, looking, discovering and creating.
<br />I created a step-by-step path (or mental model) to take anyone from a burning desire (or just another vague idea or ordinary fling) to actual implemented Business Value. </p><p>3. The steps of the mental model
<br />The first part of this session is a walk through of this mental model for Innovation / creative process.
<br />- Idea Modelling
<br />- Business Objective Modelling
<br />- Solution modelling
<br />- Feature modelling
<br />- Remaining 2 steps: Implementation and Value/Benefit Realization (not covered by the techniques)</p><p>For each of these steps - there already exists a multitude of techniques that can aid you.
<br />Bringing you safe from a burning desire to actual Implemented Business Value.</p><p>4. Digging into Techniques that could guide your journey
<br />Second part of the session is a short description of techniques I&apos;ve discovered to be usefull working with the mental model.</p><p>5. Outcome of the session 
<br />After participating in this session, I hope you will be blessed with the following:
<br />Inspired - wanting to use some of the techniques described in the session
<br />Brave - to view the percieved challenge of creating innovation as something tangable - and then just &quot;Go Do&quot;. Speaking up and help to improve when meeting horrible ideas on the path to be implemented.
<br />Driven - with the mental model and the techniques go out and help our customers/companies to create better innovative ideas

It becomes a second nature for most of us: inspect and adapt, inspect and adapt, inspect and adapt...</p><p>However, in reality these feedback cycles can be seen as multi-level communication flows with different types of information that cycle around in different cycles:
<br />- Vision and long-term goals
<br />- Short term functionalities
<br />- Planning and budget
<br />- Implementation processes and quality
<br />- Team dynamics</p><p>In order to run your feedback cycles effectively, you must run your PDCA on all of these, from start to end, from P to A.</p><p>In this session, we will take a deeper look how Scrum implements these cycles by matching them with the different Scrum Rituals and Artefacts. This way, we will identify where Scrum does and does not provide the necessary links to ensure a closed PDCA cycle on all levels. For the missing links, we will try to harvest ideas and practices to reinforce your Scrum implementation.</p></td></tr>

  <p>Did you ever encounter teams having difficulty working together?
<br />Or did you ever experience a company where no one knows the whole process, only bits and pieces?
<br />Or is your team working day and night and still nothing gets done? </p><p>I help teams to create serious improvement by using LEAN values/thinking, playing system thinking games, by making bottlenecks visible, but mostly by letting people experience the issues.</p><p>One team reduced their lead time from 5 weeks to 5 working days. Another team regained their  creativity and fun. And this gave them back their control to change their work in small visible steps.</p>

  <p>Innovative Agile Enabler | Management 3.0 Enthusiast</p><p>I believe Agile is not a process, it is an attitude. To be successful in an Agile environment you have to be creative, dynamic, open-minded, communicative and positive. Be open for change and flexible in your approach. You need to grow your organization&apos;s existing processes / techniques and to adjust them. If necessary you might need to create new tools.</p><p>Management 3.0 is about inspiring team members, team leaders, development managers, IT directors, project managers, Agile coaches and HR managers, who face the challenge of getting their organizations into an Agile mindset. The Management 3.0 goal is to grow and transform organizations into becoming great places to work.</p><p>My professional values are:
<br /><ul><li>Transparency: I believe you should share information with your team members. Sharing information will make you much stronger as a team; you can use the knowledge of all team members and create new ideas and solutions based on the actual clear status
<br /></li><li>Fairness: treat your team members equally and impartially, no matter the differences between them. Treat people the way you want to be treated. Respect is earned, and the only way to earn it is by respecting others
<br /></li><li>Trust: trust your team members, support and encourage them to be creative in their work, listen actively to their problems and offer them your full support
<br /></li><li>Professionalism: I expect team members to be professional and give their best at work and to have an ethic work conduct. Act as a craftsman, try to improve constantly and to deliver as much as possible, lead by example
<br /></li><li>Fun: work should give you energy; it should be fun. And, at the end of the day / week / project you should feel good about what you accomplished</li></ul></p>

During an agile coaching assignment at a large government organisation (The Council for the Judiciary) he worked together with Arno. There they found out that the both had (and still have!) a keen interest in education.</p><p>The first time Ward learned about eduScrum he had a conversation with students who used eduScrum. The happiness that radiated from these teenagers while talking about their school and the results it brought to them, really struck Ward in his heart. Ward immediately became a Friend of eduScrum.</p>

  <p>Agile Philosopher and Agile by Nature that&apos;s how best to describe Arno. Although IT has boosted Agility Arno is a firm believer that Agile is the paradigm for the next century, in all possible fields. Agile is a way to approach problems and should focus on finding root-cause solutions rather than trying to cover up symptoms. Having experienced all possible forms of education and finding that none of them really embrace discovering the full potential of human beings together with his experience as an Agile Coach it was only a &apos;natural&apos; step to become involved in eduScrum (Agile education). Together with Rini van Solingen and Willy Wijnands he wrote the eduScurm guide, a framework for Agile Education. With his former colleague Ward they discovered what Scrum could learn from eduScrum and started working on an analysis and presentation - based on their findings.  It&apos;s his passion to facilitate the discovery of the full potential of human beings. His agile philosophy goes further than his work only. In his free-time he dedicates his time training his sheep dogs in an Agile way, by trial and error and with a lot of love and passion they learn a lot of one another ;-)</p>

      <td class="description"><p>Marieke is part of a team that delivers product software on a regular basis. Several months ago, her team had an introductory training on extreme programming and scrum. Some of the ideas she learned about seemed interesting enough, but she is not sure if this methodology is applicable in their particular situation. After the course, some of her colleagues started to write unit tests, but there still are only a few, and they are not run very often, as far as Marieke can see. They also started to do a daily standup meeting, because according to the  trainers that is a tool to enhance communication within the team. But these meetings are rather boring, and they tend to take 1/2 hour, every day. Team members are grumbling about wasting their time.</p><p>Marieke started to think all this agile stuff is only an unusable hype. But then she heard about XP Days, and she thought &quot;well, let&apos;s give it another chance, if 150 people go to this conference, for 11 years in a row now, maybe there is more to it&quot;. She hopes she can hear from real people in real teams how they have applied these techniques, which problems occurred in their situation, and what kind of consequences that had for them.</p>

Sometimes he wonders if he&apos;s chosen the right career.</p><p>Lately, Georges has been hearing more and more about agile methods. Some of his ex-colleagues have converted from project management to agile coaching. They tell him tales of vibrant, exciting, fun projects where customers and developers live in perfect harmony. That can&apos;t be true. They must be exaggerating. Or are they....?</p>

      <td class="description"><p>Vincent is the IT manager of a large company. His teams don&apos;t do too badly. Some projects are allright; some don&apos;t fully satisfy their users. The CEO has asked him to propose a plan to increase the efficiency of his department by 10%  in the next two years. So, Vincent looks around for solutions that might help him to create and implement the plan. He has looked at a lot of things: processes, tools, consultants... He&apos;s heard that some other companies (even some reputable companies) have had success with &quot;agile&quot; methods, so he comes to the XP Day to get a taste of what &quot;agile&quot; can offer him. He doesn&apos;t know what to expect. Hippy surfer dudes? 18 year old wizz kids with piercings? Greybearded hackers? Oh well... What does he have to lose?</p>

Joke understands her customers needs, she has lots of ideas for new features that would enhance the product. She knows that this product really enhances its user&apos;s lives. That&apos;s one of the reasons her company is so succesful. But they have trouble keeping up with customer demand. Joke finds it hard to talk to the development team, to make them understand what she needs in the product. If only she and the development team could work together more efficiently, they could make this product make more of a difference. Maybe this &quot;agile&quot; stuff can help? How does product management work in agile projects? Joke hopes to meet some developers and other product managers who can help her and give her some tips.</p>
