# xpdays2016

This is a [jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/home/) site automatically
processed and hosted by github.

## how to edit
Anyone with a github account can be made editor on this repo. Editing is
can be done either through using edit links on the files in this repo,
or through cloning the repo, editing locally and pushing your commits to
this repo.

To try and make editing as accessible as possible, the approach is to
use [markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax) as much as possible (like this file). However, some of the files are in plain html so that we have more control on their formatting. The files that are in html are:

* index.html
* the program html files as exported from propile (no editing required)
* the file xpdays/Feedback/FromParticipants.html, as this file has a
  big table (hard to create in markdown and may be easily exported from
excel)
* the layout files in \_layouts and \_includes, which probably don't need a lot of editing anyway.

Other than those you should be able to easily edit files in markdown.

## do not be intimidated

There are a lot of directories in this repo. Do not let thoes intimidate
you. You will _probably never touch_ the following directories:

* \_includes, \_layouts, \_sass, css, js, fonts ontain stuff used for the layout of the site
* if you ever encounter \_site: That's just the generated site


## still to do

* Get the right sponsor logos and texts
* We may be able to make a sponsor directory with some structured data
  per sponsor so that we can genereate the sponsors section based on
that data. That wouild simplify adding a sponsor.
* Add a section for a twitter feed from @xpdaysbenelux so that the site
  is sort of dynamic without editing it
* Add feed xml so that people can follow our changes.

## Questions

* do we want to blog ? (there is an example blog entry in \_posts
* how does this relate to wordpress ?
